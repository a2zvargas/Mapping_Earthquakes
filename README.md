# Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of this repository is to store html and javascript code that creates a world map of the previous 7 days of earthquakes throughout the world.  Using leaflet, mapbox, and javascript this map also has selectable options to show the map in a drawing/rendered view, satellite imagery, or dark/night mode.  There are layers that can show all the earthquakes, only major earthquakes, tectonic plates, or all 3.
